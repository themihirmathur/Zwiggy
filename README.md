## Project Overview

Zwiggy is structured to handle the complexities of a food delivery platform through a modular approach. Each role-specific application operates as an independent microservice, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and efficient development. 

### Key Features:
- **Admin Panel**: Manage users, restaurants, orders, and system settings.
- **User Interface**: Browse restaurants, place orders, track deliveries.
- **Restaurant Owner Dashboard**: Manage menus, orders, and delivery status.
- **Delivery Personnel App**: View delivery assignments, update delivery status.

## Technology Stack

Given the Microservice Architecture, our tech stack is designed for flexibility and performance. Below is an overview of the primary technologies we plan to use:

### Backend:
- **Nest.js**: As the backend framework, providing a robust and scalable server-side application.
- **GraphQL**: For API gateway and efficient microservice communication.
- **Docker**: Containerization to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Prisma**: Database ORM for seamless data management.
- **AWS ECS**: Deployment using Amazon's Elastic Container Service, along with other AWS services for scalability and reliability.

### Frontend:
- **Next.js**: For building fast, SEO-friendly, and highly optimized web applications.
